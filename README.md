- 👋 Hi, I’m @johnsl01
- 👀 I’m interested in many things - principally engineering and numismatics 
- within these software engineering and medieval Irish numismatics 
- but other than music I am interested in most aspects of human knowledge - perhaps too many!
- music is the exception because I simply can't hear what everybody else finds so interesting in it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about financial crime detection models.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing - but if you have an interesting theory on Edward IV's Irish coinage I'd be happy to discuss it.
- 📫 How to reach me - not really hard given the above (and the id is not misleading) - left as an exercise for the student.
